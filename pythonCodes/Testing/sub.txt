1
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,904
This man is worth 500 dollars.

2
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,756
And this man's going to collect.

3
00:59:50,082 --> 00:59:53,153
He's Jake Cahill
and he lives by

4
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,439
Bounty Law.

5
00:59:54,965 --> 00:59:57,266
You don't ever bring men
alive, now do you, Jake?

6
00:59:57,322 --> 00:59:59,504
Not when there's three
of them and one of me.

7
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:06,837
What are you lookin' at,
bounty killer?

8
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:09,965
Lookin' at an ugly owl hoot
'bout to get his jaw busted.

9
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,440
Amateurs try and
take men in alive.

10
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,255
Amateurs usually don't make it.

11
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:20,242
Whether you're dead or alive,
you're just a dollar sign to

12
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:23,053
Jake Cahill on
Bounty Law.

13
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,294
Thursdays at 8:30.
Only on NBC.

14
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:31,241
Hello, everybody!

15
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:33,327
This is Allen Kincaid on
the set of the exciting hit

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,098
NBC and Screen Gems
television series

17
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,214
Bounty Law.

18
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,034
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

19
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,567
don't adjust your
television sets

20
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,592
because, well,
in a way, you are.

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,695
To my right is
Bounty Law series lead

22
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:47,139
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

23
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:49,796
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

24
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,149
Welcome, gentlemen and

25
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:52,705
thanks for taking the
time to visit with us.

26
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:54,245
Well, it's our pleasure, Al.

27
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,193
So, Rick, uh, explain
to the audience

28
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:58,741
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

29
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,592
Well...

30
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:04,425
Actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

31
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,095
Say, Jake Cahill gets
shot off a horse...

32
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:09,689
Now, can I fall off a horse?

33
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,205
Yes, I can, yes, I have.

34
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,266
Let's say I fall off
wrong and I

35
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,847
and I sprain my wrist or I-
or I twist my ankle, now...

36
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:23,208
that can put an undue
burden on production

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,772
'cause now maybe I
can't work for a week.

38
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:28,539
So, Cliff here is meant
to help carry the load.

39
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,748
Is that, uh, how you
describe your job, Cliff?

40
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,510
What, carrying his load?

41
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,424
Yeah, that's about right.

42
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,787
Join me next week on the set
of The Dick Van Dyke Show

43
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:42,560
where I'll be talking
to those comical cut-ups

44
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:44,657
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

45
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,110
Till then, this is Allen Kincaid

The face in the misty light.

83
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:24,808
Hello, Mr. Schwarz.

84
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:26,158
Whoa, Gina.

85
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,197
I, uh, I have a meeting
with a very handsome

86
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,609
cowboy man.

87
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:32,189
He's waiting for you in the bar.

00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:35,752
Well...

89
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,760
since I just finished watching

90
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,937
a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

91
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,686
I think I know who you are.

92
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:42,822
Put it there.

93
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,639
Well, it's my
pleasure, Mr. Schwartz,

94
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,782
a-and thank you
for taking an interest.

95
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:49,326
Schwarz not Schwartz.

96
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:52,154
Goddammit to hell,
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

97
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,198
My pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.

98
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,550
- Call me Marvin.
- Marvin, call me Rick.

99
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,869
Rick. Oh, that your son?

100
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,212
My son...

101
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:03,090
No, that's my stunt double
Cliff Booth, yeah.

102
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:04,114
Good to meet you.

103
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,454
We've worked together
since the, uh,

104
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,296
the last two seasons
of Bounty Law.

105
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:08,553
- Yeah.
- My car's in the shop.

106
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:09,912
He gave me a ride.

107
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,686
<i>That's a big fuckin' lie.</i>

00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,343
Oh, fuck.

112
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:19,262
Sounds like a good friend.

113
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,477
I try.

114
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:24,044
I want to send you
greetings from my wife,

115
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,498
Mary Alice Schwarz.

116
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:28,085
Oh, well, that's nice.

117
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,792
Thanks a lot.

118
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,359
We had...

119
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:39,161
a Rick Dalton double feature in
our screening room last night.

120
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:40,483
Oh, well...

121
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:43,364
That's both flattering
and embarrassing.

122
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,290
What'd you see?

123
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:47,134
35mm prints...

124
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:50,769
of Tanner and
The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

125
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,222
I hope the uh...

126
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,571
Rick Dalton uh, double
feature wasn't too uh...

127
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:03,542
painful for you and the-
and the missus.

128
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:06,181
Oh, no. Painful. Stop.

129
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:07,890
What are you saying?

130
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,710
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,247
<i>Our whole courtship,
we watched Westerns.</i>

132
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:16,547
<i>And we thoroughly enjoyed them.</i>

133
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:17,989
- Oh, that's nice.
- Really good.

134
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,134
And um,

135
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,705
anyway, she goes to bed.

<i>I pour myself a cognac.</i>

139
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,173
<i>And I watch...</i>

140
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,307
The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

141
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,201
What a picture.

142
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:36,242
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

143
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,154
Got to be so much fun.

144
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:39,251
All the shooting.

145
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,537
I love that stuff,
you know, the killing.

146
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:47,159
A lotta killing, a lotta killing.

147
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:48,724
So gentlemen,

148
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,224
the plan is we
reverse our forces

149
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,430
und drive the Allies
back into the sea!

150
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:06,083
There's nowhere to go.

151
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,280
Hermann!

152
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,105
Open the curtains!

153
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,594
<i>Jawohl!</i>

154
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,522
Anybody order fried sauerkraut?!

155
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:56,129
Burn, you Nazi basterds!

156
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,673
That's you operating the
flamethrower, isn't it?

157
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,956
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was, yeah, yeah.

158
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:04,042
It was you?

159
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,548
Yeah, l-let me tell you,
th-th-that's

160
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:07,136
one shitfuck crazy weapon.

161
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:10,801
Y-You do not want to be on
the wrong side of, boy, oh, boy.

162
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:13,683
Now, I-I practiced
with that dragon, uh...

163
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:15,725
three hours a day for two weeks.

164
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,220
N-Not just 'cause I wanted
to look good in the picture

165
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,435
but because I was

166
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,729
I was shit scared of the
damn thing, to be honest.

167
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,575
Might fucking lose!

168
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:25,781
Crisp in a massive death!

169
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,812
All right, that's too hot.

170
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,792
Anything we could
do about that heat?

171
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,761
Rick, it's a flamethrower.

172
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:33,983
Yeah.

173
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,674
So I came to the
office early today...

174
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:38,698
and I watched

175
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,584

176
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,030

00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:54,270
And you brought him
here to collect.

181
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,583
I don't even know
where here is.

182
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,797
This was the closest place.

183
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:02,031
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

184
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,865
So, bounty killer...

185
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:06,906
the name of this
town is Janustown.

186
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,341
That boy you killed...

187
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,785
Jodey Janus...

188
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:19,109
he was the baby boy of
Major Nathan Maxwell Janus.

189
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:25,243
Who is...
Major Nathan Maxwell Janus?

190
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:30,317
Well, I'll be sure

191

guest shots on uh,
episodic TV shows

206
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,698
the last couple of years.

207
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:36,340
Yeah, yeah, uh...

208
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:39,809
I'm doin' a-a pilot
for CBS right now.

209
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:41,856
It's called Lancer.

210
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:43,063
I play the heavy.

211
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:46,118
Did a... Ron Ely Tarzan
and uh...

212
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,265
Land of the Giants,
Green Hornet.

213
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:50,037
I did that show...

214
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:53,394
Bingo Martin with
that kid Scott Brown.

215
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:56,976
And I got a FBI
that airs this Sunday.

216
00:10:57,008 --> 00:11:00,700
You uh, you always play
the bad guy on these shows?

217
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,775
Yeah.

218
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:06,518
Mmm. So, and they have
a fight scene at the end?

219
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:10,652
Well, not...
Land of the Giants or FBI

220
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:12,366
but the rest, yeah.

221
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:14,155
And you lose in the fight?

222
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah, of course.
I'm the heavy

223
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:21,851
Oh... that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

224
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,355
You take Bingo Martin

225
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,054
- for example.
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:28,147
So, you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

227
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:31,108
You want to build up
his bona fide.

228
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:35,240
So you hire a guy from a
canceled show to play the heavy.

229
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:38,418
Then at the end of the
show when they fight...

230
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,723
it's hero besting heavy.

231
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:45,109
But, what the audience
sees is Bingo Martin...

232
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:48,387
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

233
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,887
You see?

234
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:51,577
Then next week,

235
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,283
it's Ron Ely.

236
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,518
The next week it's...

237
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:58,553
Bob Conrad wearing
his tight pants...

238
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:00,080
kicking your ass.

239
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,270
Yeah.

240
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,756
Now in another couple of
years playing punching bag

241
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,218
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

242
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,661
it's gonna have a
psychological effect

243
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:14,029
on how the audience
perceives you.

244
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,117
Right.

245
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:17,423
So, Rick...

246
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:20,137
who's gonna kick the shit
outta you next week?

247
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,483
Mannix?

248
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,261
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

249
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,165
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

250
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:29,552
How about Batman and Robin?
Ping! Pow!

251
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:31,810
Chum! Zoom!

252
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:35,012
Down goes you.

253
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:37,996
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

254
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,298
Or do you go to Rome

255
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,449
and star in Westerns?

256
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,804
And win fucking fights.

257
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:02,444
Muchas gracias.

258
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:06,957
All right, what the
matter, partner?

259
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,290
It's official, old buddy.

260
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,036
I'm a has-been.

261
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,712
What are you talkin' about?
What'd that guy tell you?

262
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,669
Told me the goddamn
truth is what he told me.

263
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,135
Whoa, whoa.

264
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,769
Hey.

265
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,317
I'm sorry 'bout that.
Sorry 'bout that.

266
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:26,645
Here, put these on.

267
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:29,244
Don't cry in front
of the Mexicans.

268
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,818
What's gotten you so upset, man?

269
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,073
Well, if coming
face to face with the

270
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:36,509
failure that is your career
ain't worth cryin' about,

271
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,224
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

272
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:40,293
Why? That guy in there
turn you down?

273
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:41,283
No.

274
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,830
He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

275
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,413
Well, then, what's the problem?

276
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,404
I gotta do fuckin' Italian
goddamn movies!

277
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,794
That's the fuckin' problem.

278

00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,413
<i>Four men on a search</i>

356

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,934
That... That was Polanski.

365
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:12,484
That was Roman Polanski,
h-he's lived there for a month now.

366
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:14,070
First time I seen him.

367
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,213
Holy shit.

00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,346
What I always say?

369
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:24,260
Most important thing in this town,
is when you're making money,

370
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:26,397
you buy a house in town,
you don't rent.

371
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,032
Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

372
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,545

means you live here.

373
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,198

livin' next door to me?

378
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:43,041
The director of Rosemary's
fuckin' Baby, that's who.

379
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,338
Polanski's the hottest director
in town right now,

380
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:46,570
probably the world!

381
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,024
He's my next door
fuckin' neighbor.

382
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,258

383
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:51,861
I mean, who knows
what can happen?

384
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,882
Shit, I-I could be

385

386
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,371
So, you're feeling better now?

387
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:00,234
Oh, yeah, yes.

She... was engaged to him.

554
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:11,789
And she...

555
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:15,644
flew to the UK

556
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:18,338
to make a film with him

557
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:21,806
and broke off her
engagement with him

558
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,771
and married him.

559
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:28,997
Then they... moved to Los Angeles...

560
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:32,945
and then the three of 'em
have been inseparable.

561
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:35,370

- Howdy.

648
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:01,035
Now, I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

649
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,566
I don't want this Western
costume the way they costume

650
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:06,409
The Big Valley and Bonanza
from the last decade.

651
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:09,932
I want a zeitgeist
flair in the costumes.

652
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:12,675
I mean, nothing anachronistic,

653
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,985

654
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,945
Especially when it
comes to you, Caleb.

655
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:22,747
First off, I wanna
give him a mustache.

656
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:27,438
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

657
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,840
Now, about his jacket...

658
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:31,959
I wanna give him a
hippie jacket.

659
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:34,328
Something that he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

660
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:36,315
and look like the
hippest guy in the room.

661
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,752
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket,

662
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,921
fringes all down the arm.

663
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:43,326
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

664
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,184
he could hit the
strip in it tonight.

665
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,137
That's my girl.

666
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:49,112

667
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:50,707
W-What about my hair?

668
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,391
I wanna go with a
different hairstyle.

669
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:53,968
Oh, what?

670
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:56,033
Something more... hippie-ish.

671
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,745
Well... you want me
to look like a hippie?

672
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:02,875
Well, think less hippie, more...

673
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:04,431

674
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:10,192
Say... Sam, Sam, uh...

675
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:13,570
You got me covered up
in all this, uh...

676
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,617
this... junk.

677
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:18,121
Uh, how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

678
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:20,226
I hope they don't.

679
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,165
Hmm.

680
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:25,845
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

681
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,981

728
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:12,123
Hey, Randy.

729
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:15,381
Cliff.

730
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:18,087
So, you're still with Rick, huh?

731
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:20,190
Still here.

732
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:22,420
He in there?

733
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:23,928
Yeah, just knock.

734
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,702
Look, j-just put him
into wardrobe, all right?

735
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:34,786
What's it gonna hurt? Then if you
need him, you got him, right?

736
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:38,551
Then I gotta have a conversation
with that wardrobe assistant,

737
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:40,750
and man, she's a fuckin' bitch,
I just don't...

738
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:43,846
Look, look, Randy, I'm askin'
you to help me out, man.

739
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:47,546
If the answer's no, the answer's no.
Not-Not no with excuses.

740
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:49,617
Hey, man.

741
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:53,862
This ain't a fuckin'
Andy McLaglen picture, you know.

742
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:56,726
And I can't afford to hire a
bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes

743
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:58,571
and sit around talkin'
to each other all day

744
00:40:58,596 --> 00:41:00,468
on the chance
that I might use 'em.

745
00:41:00,581 --> 00:41:02,454
I got a four man team here, Rick.

746
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:04,655
I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

747
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:06,941
And you know,
I-I gotta look after my dudes.

748
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:10,762
Hey, a-and if your dudes were
a better match for me,

749
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:12,365
I'd say, o-okay,
you got me, b-b-but

750
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,684
but th-that's not the case
and you know it.

751
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:15,819
He's a great fuckin'
match for me.

752
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:16,851
Yeah, yeah, I know.

753
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:18,860
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

754
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:21,136
Shit, th-throw him
off a building, right?

755
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:23,977
Light him on fire, hit him
with a fucking Lincoln, right?

756
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:25,813
Get creative,
do whatever you want.

757
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:27,415
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

758
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,345
Rick.

759
00:41:28,377 --> 00:41:29,369
Yeah.

760
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,258
I don't dig him.

761
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:37,845
And I don't dig the
vibe he brings on set.

762
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:41,548
What, is there some old
beef between you two?

763
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:42,811
Come on, man.

764
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:43,821
What?

765
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:46,551
The dude killed his fuckin' wife.

766
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,217
Oh... come on, man.

767
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,480
You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

768
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:53,179
Yes, Rick, I do.

769
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:56,161
And I work with my wife
and she believes it.

770
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,855
She didn't want his
creepy ass around.

771
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:04,686
You know, this is probably
the shittiest weather ever.

772
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:08,118
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

773
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:10,420
with the shittiest person.

774
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:14,037
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser."

775
00:42:14,062 --> 00:42:15,099
"He's a loser."

776
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:17,052
They all said it,
"He's a fuckin' loser",

777
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,447
and I didn't believe them.

778
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,472
So, I guess I'm
the fuckin' idiot.

779
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:23,219
And now you're
not gonna talk to me?

780
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:25,354
What, you don't
feel like fighting?

781
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:27,580
Well, I feel like fucking fight.

782
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:30,715
And I've been up here
by myself for four hours

783
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,217
on this fucking
shithole of a boat...

784
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:34,977
Yeah.

785
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,838
He's a goddamn war hero.

786
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:50,605
Okay, you fuckin' horse's ass.

787
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:52,740
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

788
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:57,884
Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,

789
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:00,447
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

790
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:03,389
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

791
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,032
You know my wife,
Janet, don't you?

792
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:07,783
Yeah.

793
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:09,521
Steer clear of her.

794
00:43:10,503 --> 00:43:13,407
Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

795
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:15,029
What I admire is

796
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:18,205
in his sport, there's
an element of true combat.

797
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:21,034
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

798
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,186
that's not two
athletes posturing.

799
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:24,999
That's combat.

800
00:43:25,382 --> 00:43:28,286
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

801
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,378
If you don't beat him,

802
00:43:31,036 --> 00:43:32,354
he kills you.

803
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,644
That's beyond athletics.

804
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:38,069
That's beyond Wide World of
Sports, you know?

805
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,398
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

806
00:43:40,438 --> 00:43:42,327
That's what I admire.

807
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:44,552
In martial arts tournaments,

808
00:43:44,782 --> 00:43:47,980
they won't let you fight like that.
It's very frustrating.

809
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,849
You stand in front of a guy,

810
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:51,461
you just wanna let him have it.

811
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:54,245
But you can't.

812
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:57,967
So you gotta do this
play-acting, pattycake version.

813
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,348
Cassius Clay,
Sonny Liston, Joe Lewis.

814
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:04,686
The colored boxer,
not that white kickboxing asshole.

815
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,738
They do what they
need to do to win.

816
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:11,498
They unleash as much
punishment as they have to

817
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,642
to defeat the other guy.

818
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:15,699
But in martial arts tournaments,

819
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:18,254
I do to win what
they do to win.

820
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,226
I unleash all my power.

821
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:23,461
I kill people.

822
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:26,003
Well, if you fought
Cassius Clay, who would win?

823
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:29,065
Well, that would never happen.

824
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,216
But if you did, what do
you think would happen?

825
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:34,525
I'd make him a cripple.

826
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:38,650
Hey, you.

827
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:40,225
What's your name?

828
00:44:40,337 --> 00:44:42,377
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

829
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,468
My name's Cliff.

830
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:47,873
I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.

831
00:44:47,966 --> 00:44:49,101
Stuntman?

832
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:50,545
Yeah.

833
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,841
You know, you're kind of
pretty for a stuntman.

834
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:54,856
That's what they tell me.

835
00:44:55,075 --> 00:44:58,710
So, did I say
something funny, stuntman?

836
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:02,067
- Yeah, you kinda did.
- What's so funny?

837
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:04,270
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

838
00:45:04,365 --> 00:45:05,945
I'm just here to do a job.

839
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,933
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying,

840
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,562
but I'm not saying
anything funny.

841
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:11,601
So, what do you
think is so funny?

842
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,944
What I think is...

843
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:20,299
you're a little man with a
big mouth and a big chip.

844
00:45:20,346 --> 00:45:21,981
And I think you
should be embarrassed

845
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:23,672
to suggest that you'd
be anything more

846
00:45:23,697 --> 00:45:26,721
than a stain on the seat of
Cassius Clay's trunks.

847
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,123
Brother...

848
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:30,083
you're the one
with the big mouth.

849
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:31,887
And I would really
enjoy closing it

850
00:45:31,912 --> 00:45:34,110
especially in front
of all my friends.

851
00:45:34,963 --> 00:45:38,058
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

852
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:39,745
That means...

853
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,554
we get into a fight,
I accidentally kill you,

854
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:44,258
I go to jail.

855
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:48,089
Anybody accidentally kills
anybody in a fight, they go to jail.

856
00:45:48,114 --> 00:45:49,551
It's called manslaughter.

857
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,258
And I think all that lethal weapon
horseshit is just an excuse

858
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,118
so you dancers never have
to get in a real fight.

859
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:58,128
Okay.

860
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,794
How about a friendly contest?

861
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:05,327
No punching in the face,
two out of three.

862
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,854
Who puts who
on the ground first.

863
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,600
Nobody tries to hurt
nobody, just...

864
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:12,552
who ends up on their butt.

865
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:18,883
That's a great idea, Kato.

866
00:46:31,106 --> 00:46:32,908
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kinda famous.

867
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:34,233
That guy?

868
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:35,892
For what?

869
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,233
Killed his wife and
got away with it.

870
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,003
That guy?

871
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:41,609
That guy.

872
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:07,633
Not bad, Kato.

873
00:47:08,775 --> 00:47:10,180
Try that again.

874
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:53,272
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

875
00:47:53,935 --> 00:47:56,454
What the fuck is going on here?

876
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:59,303
Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.

877
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:00,891
The fuck are you thinking?

878
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,689
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

879
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:05,770
Don't fucking Janet me, you prick.

880
00:48:05,823 --> 00:48:08,164
Hey! What's up, babe?

881
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,610
"What's up", Randy
is that your loser asshole

882
00:48:11,635 --> 00:48:13,564
wife-killing buddy boy here

883
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:15,381
was beating the
shit out of Bruce!

884
00:48:15,406 --> 00:48:16,675
What?

885
00:48:16,923 --> 00:48:17,867
Hey, Randy.

886
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:18,842
Cliff!

887
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,795
What the fuck, man?

888
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,171
Let me just say...

889
00:48:22,254 --> 00:48:24,191
nobody beat the
shit out of Bruce.

890
00:48:24,412 --> 00:48:26,571
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

891
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:29,741
I think that dent in the car
says somethin' different.

892
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:33,196
Oh, my God!

893
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:35,869
What the fuck did
you do to my car?

894
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,089
What the fuck did
you do to her car?

895
00:48:38,595 --> 00:48:40,031
I threw this little prick into it

896
00:48:40,056 --> 00:48:41,802
but I did not know
it was her car.

897
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:43,595
Get the wardrobe off,

898
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:45,286
get your shit

899
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:46,556
and get fucked!

900
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:47,725
- Janet!
- What?

901
00:48:47,764 --> 00:48:49,152
I will handle this.

902
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,000
Then, fucking handle it, Randy!

903
00:48:52,143 --> 00:48:53,476
Cliff...

904
00:48:54,173 --> 00:48:55,657
get the wardrobe off,

905
00:48:55,729 --> 00:48:57,229
get your shit

906
00:48:57,546 --> 00:48:59,578
and get off the lot.

907
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:04,102

I'm a friend of Terry's

923
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,584
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

924
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:13,750
This is the Polanski

00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,426

Hey, Rick!

940
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,091
I know we just broke for lunch,

941
00:50:58,116 --> 00:51:00,886
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

942
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:02,482
Give the glue a chance to dry.

943
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,550
No worries, honey.
I got my book.

944
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:06,751
Say, say...

945
00:51:06,822 --> 00:51:08,638
Where's the bad guy saloon?

946
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,857
You just go straight
to Western town,

947
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:13,211
take a right and a left
and you'll see it right there.

948
00:51:13,259 --> 00:51:14,473
Thanks, honey.

949
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:17,004
Hello.

950
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:21,079
Hello.

951
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:24,405
Hello.

952
00:52:28,669 --> 00:52:30,699
Bother you if
I sat next to you,

953
00:52:30,724 --> 00:52:32,312
and read my book, too?

954
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:35,631
I don't know.

955
00:52:36,964 --> 00:52:38,483
Would you bother me?

956
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,824
I'll try not to.

957
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:45,252
Sit.

958
00:53:32,283 --> 00:53:34,156
Sorry. Sorry 'bout that.

959
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,927
You don't eat lunch?

960
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:45,697
I've got a scene after lunch.

961
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:47,641
Yeah?

962
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,164
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

963
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:54,300
I believe it's the
job of an actor,

964
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:56,571
and I say actor not actress

965
00:53:56,596 --> 00:53:59,371
because the word
actress is nonsensical.

966
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,220
It's the actor's job

967
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:03,955
to avoid impediments
to their performance.

968
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,489
It's the actor's job

969
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:08,324
to strive for 100% effectiveness.

970
00:54:08,629 --> 00:54:13,208
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit

971
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,498
that's meaningful.

972
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:17,518
Who are you?

973
00:54:17,543 --> 00:54:19,273
You can call me Mirabella.

974
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:22,093
Mi-Mirabella what?

975
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:23,791
Mirabella Lancer.

976
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:27,766
No, no, c-come on,
W-What's your real name?

977
00:54:29,254 --> 00:54:30,460
When we're on set,

978
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:33,374
I prefer to only be referred
to by my character's name.

979
00:54:33,485 --> 00:54:36,278
It helps me immerse in
the reality of the story.

980
00:54:36,734 --> 00:54:38,298
I've tried it both ways and I'm

981
00:54:38,337 --> 00:54:41,305
always just a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

982
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,418
If I can be a tiny bit better...

983
00:54:43,811 --> 00:54:45,470
I want to be.

984
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:51,277
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

985
00:54:54,903 --> 00:54:58,601
Thought it was
pronounced Caleb DeCoteau.

986
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,248
I'm pretty sure it's DeCoteau.

987
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:06,052
- DeCoteau.
- Mm-hmm.

988
00:55:06,938 --> 00:55:09,351
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

989
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,152
What are you reading?

990
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,661
It's a biography on Walt Disney.

991
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:34,530
It's fascinating.

992
00:55:34,555 --> 00:55:36,428
He's a genius, you know.

993
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:39,472
I mean, once in every 50
or 100 years kind of genius.

994
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:41,869
Wh-What are you, twelve?

995
00:55:42,975 --> 00:55:44,324
I'm eight.

996
00:55:45,094 --> 00:55:46,690
What are you reading?

997
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:49,689
Just a Western.

998
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:52,411
What does that mean?
Is it good?

999
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,046
Pretty good.

1000
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:56,169
What's the story?

1001
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,913
Haven't finished it yet.

1002
00:55:59,095 --> 00:56:02,183
I didn't ask for the whole story.

1003
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:04,537
What's the idea of the story?

1004
00:56:05,304 --> 00:56:10,733
Well... it's about, uh, this guy
who's a bronco buster.

1005
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:13,856
It's a story of his life.

1006
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:16,479
The guy's name is Tom Breezy

1007
00:56:16,504 --> 00:56:19,107
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

1008
00:56:19,516 --> 00:56:23,739
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s and-and

1009
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:25,886
young and good-lookin', he could

1010
00:56:25,911 --> 00:56:28,475
he could break any horse
that you can throw at him.

1011
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:31,309
Back then, he just had a way.

1012
00:56:31,843 --> 00:56:34,129
Now, he's into his, uh,

1013
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:37,968
late 30s and takes a bad fall
and messes up his hip

1014
00:56:38,016 --> 00:56:42,048
He's not... crippled
or anything like that, but...

1015
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,031
but he's got spine problems

1016
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:48,173
he's never had before
and he spends, uh,

1017
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:53,098
more of his days in pain than
he ever did before.

1018
00:56:53,191 --> 00:56:55,691
Jeepers, it sounds like a good novel.

1019
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:58,419
Yeah, it's not bad.

1020
00:56:59,856 --> 00:57:01,427
Where are you in it?

1021
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:03,895
About midway.

1022
00:57:05,451 --> 00:57:07,864
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

1023
00:57:08,631 --> 00:57:10,813
Uh, he's, uh...

1024
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:14,036
He's not the best anymore.

1025
00:57:15,437 --> 00:57:17,397
In fact, far from it.

1026
00:57:19,376 --> 00:57:22,704
He's comin' to terms of what
it's like to be slightly more...

1027
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:27,342
use...

1028
00:57:35,346 --> 00:57:37,052
Slightly more useless

1029
00:57:37,764 --> 00:57:39,168
each day.

1030
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:56,803
I-It's okay, Caleb.

1031
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:58,422
It's okay.

1032
00:57:58,815 --> 00:58:00,815
Sounds like a really sad book.

1033
00:58:01,236 --> 00:58:02,966
Poor Easy Breezy.

1034
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:06,549
I'm practically cryin'
and I haven't even read it.

1035
00:58:07,602 --> 00:58:09,864
About 15 years,
you'll be livin' it.

1036
00:58:10,046 --> 00:58:11,260
What?

1037
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,023

You know somethin', you, uh...

1041
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:26,208
you might be right
about this book.

1042
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:29,870
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

1043
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:35,392
I don't like names
like "pumpkinpuss"...

1044
00:58:36,257 --> 00:58:38,011
but since you're upset...

1045
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:40,666

Thanks so much.

1059

- Well, good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

1060
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:08,027
- Have a good time at Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

1061
01:00:08,076 --> 01:00:09,074
Take care.

1062
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:16,981
Oh, hey.

1063
01:01:17,338 --> 01:01:18,440
Hello.

1064
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:20,791
How can I help you, young lady?

1065
01:01:23,439 --> 01:01:25,255
I'm here to pick
up a first edition

1066
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,709
of Thomas Hardy's
<i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

1067
01:01:27,836 --> 01:01:29,177
It's under Polanski.

1068
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:30,885
Yeah, you're talking
books here, kid.

1069
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,981
Oh, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

1070
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:34,723
- I just read it.
- Yeah?

1071
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:36,818
I'm getting it as a
gift for my husband.

1072
01:01:39,814 --> 01:01:42,139
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

1073
01:01:42,186 --> 01:01:43,519
Jim Stacy.

1074
01:01:43,544 --> 01:01:45,197
It's my show. Welcome aboard.

1075
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,208
We're real glad to have a pro like
you playing the heavy on the pilot.

1076
01:01:48,419 --> 01:01:49,792
And I gotta tell ya...

1077
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:53,378
I came damn close to being in
The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

1078
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,405
- No kiddin'?
- Yeah!

1079
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:59,075
I just got my part for sheer luck.

1080
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:02,571
Up until two weeks before
shootin', Fabian was in the part,

1081
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:05,433
Th-Then he breaks his
shoulder doing The Virginian,

1082
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:06,656
that's how I got it, so.

1083
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,838
Ah!

1084
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:12,316
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
somethin' I heard about.

1085
01:02:13,117 --> 01:02:15,879
Was it true you almost got the
McQueen part in The Great Escape?

1086
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,844
Hilts, isn't it?

1087
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:20,644
Captain Hilts, actually.

1088
01:02:20,836 --> 01:02:23,157
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18.

1089
01:02:23,182 --> 01:02:25,680
Never had an audition.
Never had a meetin'.

1090
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:27,178
N-Never met John Sturges.

1091
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:29,555
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

1092
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,150
I almost got the part.

1093
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:33,333
Engineer?

1094
01:02:33,364 --> 01:02:34,389
Flyer.

1095
01:02:34,414 --> 01:02:36,578
I suppose you're what's
called in American Army...

1096
01:02:36,672 --> 01:02:37,981
a hotshot pilot.

1097
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:42,753
But, the story goes,
for a brief moment,

1098
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:46,127
McQueen almost
passed on the movie

1099
01:02:46,152 --> 01:02:47,292
and in that brief moment,

1100
01:02:47,317 --> 01:02:49,409
I-I apprently was
on the list of four.

1101
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:51,053
You have other plans?

1102
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,079
I haven't seen Berlin yet from
the ground or from the air

1103
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,350
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

1104
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:57,492
You and who?

1105
01:02:57,545 --> 01:02:59,489
Me... and the three Georges.

1106
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:00,894
Which three Georges?

1107
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:02,673
Peppard, Maharis, and Chakiris.

1108
01:03:02,698 --> 01:03:04,122
- Oh, man!
- Yeah.

1109
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:05,443
That's gotta hurt.

1110
01:03:05,468 --> 01:03:07,546
Yeah, well, I didn't get it.

1111
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:09,142
McQueen did it.

1112
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,921
And frankly,
I never had a chance.

1113
01:03:13,571 --> 01:03:15,468
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

1114
01:03:15,976 --> 01:03:17,357
Captain Hilts.

1115
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:18,978
20 days.

1116
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:20,293
Right.

1117
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:24,143
Oh, uh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

1118
01:03:25,678 --> 01:03:26,906
Cooler.

1119
01:04:22,378 --> 01:04:23,418
One, please.

1120
01:04:23,686 --> 01:04:25,233
75 cents.

1121
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,572
What if I'm in the movie?

1122
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:32,354
What do you mean?

1123
01:04:32,473 --> 01:04:34,703
I mean, I'm in the movie.

1124
01:04:34,989 --> 01:04:36,537
I'm Sharon Tate.

1125
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:38,455
You're in this?

1126
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:41,606
Mm-hmm. I play Miss Carlson.
The klutz.

1127
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:44,056
That's me.

1128
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:48,076
But that's the girl from
Valley of the Dolls.

1129
01:04:49,658 --> 01:04:51,522
Well, that's me,

1130
01:04:51,547 --> 01:04:53,984
the girl from Valley of the Dolls.

1131
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:57,179
- Really?
- Really.

1132
01:04:59,626 --> 01:05:01,641
Hey, Ruben! Come out here.

1133
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:06,950
This is the girl from
Valley of the Dolls.

1134
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,263
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

1135
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:12,333
- The girl from Peyton Place?
- No, the other one.

1136
01:05:12,405 --> 01:05:14,817
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

1137
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:16,442
Oh...

1138
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:17,607
She's in this movie.

1139
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,464
Oh.

1140
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:19,712
Sharon Tate.

1141
01:05:19,864 --> 01:05:21,046
Well...

1142
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:23,256
Welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

1143
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:24,910
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

1144
01:05:25,096 --> 01:05:26,666
Would you like to come
in and see the show?

1145
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:27,728
Could I?

1146
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:28,897
By all means.

1147
01:05:30,246 --> 01:05:31,318
Thank you.

1148
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:35,252
Hey... can I get a picture?

1149
01:05:35,315 --> 01:05:36,553
Oh, sure!

1150
01:05:41,224 --> 01:05:43,311
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster?

1151
01:05:43,344 --> 01:05:45,153
So people will
know who you are.

1152
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:46,764
Okay.

1153
01:05:47,396 --> 01:05:48,364
Could you?

1154
01:06:00,867 --> 01:06:02,288
Would you like
some refreshments?

1155
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,673
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

1187
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:47,024

01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:49,794

01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,652
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

1192
01:07:56,676 --> 01:07:58,208
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

1193
01:08:07,198 --> 01:08:09,882
<i>Some kind of hotel
you got here.</i>

1194
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,077
<i>Half a bottle's
better than none.</i>

1195
01:09:02,196 --> 01:09:04,059
That's far enough, jughead.

1196
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,946
Name's not jughead.

1197
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:09,838
What you doin' 'round here, boy?

1198
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:11,324
I'm thirsty.

1199
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,983
That's a saloon, ain't it?

1200
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,501
Oh, yeah.

1201
01:09:14,544 --> 01:09:15,982
That's a saloon.

1202
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,740
Only you can't come in.

1203
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:19,193
Mr. Gilbert.

1204
01:09:20,805 --> 01:09:24,135
Don't let me stop you
from earnin' your money.

1205
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,480
I know how bored and restless
you get when you run out of...

1206
01:09:29,536 --> 01:09:30,884
tamales.

1207
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,747
But Mr. Gilbert, if I was you...

1208
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:38,315
you'd find out that
jughead's name.

1209
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:42,494
Allow me to introduce
the two of ya.

1210
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,592
This here is Bob Gilbert.

1211
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,283
The businessman?

1212
01:09:49,488 --> 01:09:50,734
That's right.

1213
01:09:51,131 --> 01:09:53,083
Business Bob Gilbert.

1214
01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:55,557
Who might he be, Caleb?

1215
01:09:55,787 --> 01:09:58,311
Oh, that's a fella
by the name of Madrid.

1216
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,943
Johnny Madrid.

1217
01:10:02,025 --> 01:10:04,319
Who's Johnny Madrid?

1218
01:10:10,177 --> 01:10:12,074
He ain't from 'round here.

1219
01:10:12,232 --> 01:10:13,701
No, really.

1220
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:15,629
Who is he, Caleb?

1221
01:10:20,086 --> 01:10:21,681
Well, you're about to find out.

1222
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:24,949
Businessman.

1223
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:44,142
Ready when you are,

1224
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,437
Gilbert.

1225
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,810
Again, mas?

1226
01:11:27,339 --> 01:11:28,974
Johnny Madrid.

1227
01:11:34,726 --> 01:11:36,075
How long's it been?

1228
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,583
Since that time in Juarez, 'bout...

1229
01:11:38,758 --> 01:11:40,123
three years ago.

1230
01:11:40,474 --> 01:11:42,363
Come on in, have a drink.

1231
01:11:43,294 --> 01:11:45,913
Hell, in that case...

1232
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,159
buy you a drink, Caleb?

1233
01:11:50,328 --> 01:11:51,764
Sure, Johnny.

1234
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,019
How 'bout some mezcal?

1235
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:57,459
Like that time in Juarez.

1236
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:00,757
A lot of people died that day.

1237
01:12:01,781 --> 01:12:03,083
Yes, they did.

1238
01:12:04,461 --> 01:12:06,176
But we had a good time.

1239
01:12:06,953 --> 01:12:08,016
Didn't we?

1240
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:09,144
Yeah.

1241
01:12:09,223 --> 01:12:10,374
We did.

1242
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:13,154
After you, DeCoteau.

1243
01:12:14,165 --> 01:12:15,507
Pepe!

1244
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:18,744
Get your behind behind that
bar, I have a guest.

1245
01:12:27,287 --> 01:12:28,501
Dos mezcal.

1246
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:33,308
<i>You have food?</i>

1247
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:35,303
<i>Beans and tortillas.</i>

1248
01:12:35,366 --> 01:12:36,620
How's some beans?

1249
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:39,370
I've had worse.

1250
01:12:39,698 --> 01:12:41,753
<i>Give us a plate of beans.</i>

1251
01:12:42,118 --> 01:12:43,357
One dollar.

1252
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:49,531
To my wife
and all my sweethearts...

1253
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,476
may they never meet.

1254
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,231
Señor Madrid.

1255
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,073
Would you care to
join me at my table

1256
01:13:03,098 --> 01:13:04,610
where I entertain my guests?

1257
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:06,802
I'd be delighted,
Monsieur DeCoteau.

1258
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,462
Take the bottle wit' ya.

1259
01:13:12,641 --> 01:13:14,014
So Johnny.

1260
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,577
What brings you
to Royal Del Hole?

1261
01:13:18,608 --> 01:13:20,496
Oh, you know me, Caleb.

1262
01:13:21,306 --> 01:13:22,393
The money.

1263
01:13:24,202 --> 01:13:25,845
And who's paying around here?

1264
01:13:26,364 --> 01:13:27,554
I hope you.

1265
01:13:30,046 --> 01:13:31,886
And what have you
heard about me?

1266
01:13:32,556 --> 01:13:34,342
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch,

1267
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:36,356
all the cattle
you've appropriated.

1268
01:13:36,715 --> 01:13:38,827
A lotta land, lotta
cows, a lotta money,

1269
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:39,993
no law to speak of,

1270
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:41,464
and nothin' but an
old man and some

1271
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:43,758
Mexican ranch hands
to shoo ya off.

1272
01:13:46,806 --> 01:13:47,767
Hey...

1273
01:13:47,944 --> 01:13:51,070
where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours' fiddle?

1274
01:13:51,817 --> 01:13:52,992
She's asleep.

1275
01:13:53,321 --> 01:13:55,082
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

1276
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:58,726
with her fiddle and her bow
and entertain my guest.

1277
01:13:59,471 --> 01:14:00,526
Si, señor.

1278
01:14:01,965 --> 01:14:04,425
But please,
don't hurt her this time.

1279
01:14:05,889 --> 01:14:07,532
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1280
01:14:08,215 --> 01:14:10,620
I just want her to play the fiddle.

1281
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:15,603
Line?

1282
01:14:15,628 --> 01:14:17,674
Go... go fetch her and tell her what?

1283
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:19,786
Go fetch her and tell
her I'll give her

1284
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:21,398
a fat five-dollar gold piece...

1285
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,074
Right, right, go fetch her
and tell her I'll give her a fat

1286
01:14:23,099 --> 01:14:25,074
fat five-
fat five-dollar gold piece

1287
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:27,255
if she played her little chili
pepper heart out, right?

1288
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,239
- Right.
- Yeah.

1289
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,216
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1290
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,867
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1291
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:40,281
Now, go fetch her and tell her

1292
01:14:40,338 --> 01:14:42,424
I'll give her a fat
five-dollar gold piece

1293
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:44,808
if she played her little
chili pepper heart out.

1294
01:14:45,525 --> 01:14:46,589
Go on!

1295
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:53,383
So, Johnny.

1296
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:57,025
What else you heard, hmm?

1297
01:14:57,735 --> 01:14:59,926
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard

1298
01:15:00,227 --> 01:15:03,446
but Lancer's got money.

1299
01:15:04,303 --> 01:15:05,906
At some point,

1300
01:15:06,322 --> 01:15:08,473
he's gonna hire some guns

1301
01:15:08,764 --> 01:15:10,835
and push back.

1302
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:19,422
Line? Line, line, line...

1303
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,695
Maybe he already has.

1304
01:15:23,878 --> 01:15:24,926
Maybe...

1305
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,355
Goddammit!
I fucked this whole thing up!

1306
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:29,424
Damn, I fucked
this whole thing up.

1307
01:15:29,497 --> 01:15:30,614
Just go back, please.

1308
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:31,954
Could we just cut?
Could we just cut?

1309
01:15:32,026 --> 01:15:34,994
- No, really, just say the fucking line!
- No, Sam, please.

1310
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,449
"Maybe he already has"
"Maybe he already has"

1311
01:15:37,474 --> 01:15:39,966
Argh! Goddammit!
Alright! Alright! Alright!

1312
01:15:40,129 --> 01:15:41,486
Whoo!

1313
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:43,795
Goddamn outlaw, Rick.
Come on now.

1314
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,381
Hoo!

1315
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:47,643
I got it. I got it.

1316
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:49,686
Go back a bit, would you?

1317
01:15:49,789 --> 01:15:51,695
No, he's right. Back to one.

1318
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:55,809
- Use all that anger, use it.
- Oh, I'ma use it.

1319
01:15:55,893 --> 01:15:58,117
- You show me tough.
- Mm-hmm.

1320
01:16:00,614 --> 01:16:03,534
And... action.

1321
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,718
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard.

1322
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:11,921
But Lancer's got money.

1323
01:16:12,756 --> 01:16:14,058
At some point,

1324
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,101
he's gonna hire some guns...

1325
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,528
and push back.

1326
01:16:22,772 --> 01:16:24,859
Maybe he already has.

1327
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:27,684
Maybe.

1328
01:16:31,002 --> 01:16:32,463
Maybe I don't like Lancer.

1329
01:16:33,872 --> 01:16:35,849
Maybe I don't like his boots.

1330
01:16:37,438 --> 01:16:40,325
Maybe I don't like the
way he uses those boots

1331
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,922
to step on people.

1332
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,745
What the fuck was that?!

1333
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,703
Jesus Christ!

1334
01:16:50,076 --> 01:16:51,092
Fuck!

1335
01:16:51,894 --> 01:16:52,870
Shit.

1336
01:16:54,118 --> 01:16:55,769
Damn it, Rick, you screwed up

1337
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,588
the fucking lines!

1338
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,612
Embarrass yourself like that in
front of all those goddamn people!

1339
01:17:00,735 --> 01:17:02,306
You're drinkin' all night.

1340
01:17:02,371 --> 01:17:04,786
Fuckin' drinkin' again,
eight goddamn

1341
01:17:04,857 --> 01:17:06,563
fuckin' whiskey sours.

1342
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:10,246
Fuckin' bullshit.

1343
01:17:11,672 --> 01:17:14,188
You're a fuckin' miserable drunk.

1344
01:17:14,228 --> 01:17:16,720
Fuckin' remember your fuckin' lines.

1345
01:17:16,793 --> 01:17:18,189
I practiced 'em!

1346
01:17:18,214 --> 01:17:20,253
And now I don't look like
I goddamn practiced 'em!

1347
01:17:20,297 --> 01:17:22,153
You're sittin' there
like a fuckin' baboon...

1348
01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:22,943
Blah-blah-blah...

1349
01:17:22,991 --> 01:17:23,887
Duh-duh-duh...

1350
01:17:23,929 --> 01:17:25,377
Duh-duh-duh-duh. Fuck!

1351
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:26,370
Eight fuckin' whiskey sours.

1352
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:29,253
I couldn't stop at fuckin'
three or four, I have eight?!

1353
01:17:29,308 --> 01:17:30,339
Why?

1354
01:17:30,388 --> 01:17:33,134
You're a fuckin' alcoholic,
I drink too much!

1355
01:17:33,234 --> 01:17:35,782
Every fuckin' night!
Every fuckin' night!

1356
01:17:35,829 --> 01:17:37,917
That's it, that's fuckin' it!

1357
01:17:38,002 --> 01:17:39,334
That's fuckin' it.

1358
01:17:39,358 --> 01:17:41,367
You stop drinkin' right now, alright?

1359
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,892
Make a promise to yourself
you'll stop fuckin' drinkin'.

1360
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:50,564
Dammit!

1361
01:17:51,472 --> 01:17:53,373
You gonna show
that fucking crew.

1362
01:17:53,398 --> 01:17:55,533
You gonna show that
goddamn Jim Stacy.

1363
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:57,817
You gonna show all them
on that goddamn fuckin' set

1364
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:00,198
who the fuck Rick Dalton is, alright?

1365
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,085
Lemme tell you somethin'...

1366
01:18:02,142 --> 01:18:04,427
you don't get these lines right...

1367
01:18:04,866 --> 01:18:07,628
I'ma blow your fuckin'
brains out tonight.

1368
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:08,945
Alright?

1369
01:18:09,025 --> 01:18:12,644
Your brains are gonna be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

1370
01:18:12,669 --> 01:18:14,324
I mean it, motherfucker.

1371
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,197
Get your shit together.

1372
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:23,304

I'm going to Chatsworth.

Chatsworth?

1421
01:21:51,484 --> 01:21:54,184

dive you to Chatsworth?

I'm their favorite part of their
L.A. vacation, you know.

1425
01:22:00,823 --> 01:22:02,504
They'll be telling stories about

1426
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:04,426
a Hollywood hippie girl

1427
01:22:04,474 --> 01:22:06,617

No.

1449
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:53,912
Are you some
old cowboy guy that

1450
01:22:53,948 --> 01:22:55,067
used to make movies there?

01:22:55,111 --> 01:22:56,182

1453
01:22:59,077 --> 01:23:01,783
Surprised how accurate that
description of me really is.

1454
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:05,311
Some old cowboy guy who used
to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

1455
01:23:06,043 --> 01:23:07,376
You used to...

1456
01:23:07,718 --> 01:23:10,773
make Westerns at the ranch
back in the old-timey days?

1457
01:23:13,212 --> 01:23:15,950
Well, if by the old-timey days

1458
01:23:15,975 --> 01:23:18,046
you mean television
eight years ago...

1459
01:23:18,097 --> 01:23:19,279
yeah.

1460
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,811
You an actor?

1461
01:23:20,889 --> 01:23:22,516
No, I'm a stuntman.

1462
01:23:23,674 --> 01:23:24,975

1463
01:23:26,538 --> 01:23:27,840
That's way better.

1464
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,399
Why is that way better?

1465
01:23:31,287 --> 01:23:32,631
Actors are phony.

1466
01:23:32,656 --> 01:23:33,621
Oh.

1467
01:23:33,646 --> 01:23:35,266
They just say lines
that other people write

1468
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,195
and pretend to murder
people on their...

01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:02,090
Yeah.

1500
01:25:06,764 --> 01:25:08,137

1502
01:25:11,214 --> 01:25:13,468

you are too old to fuck me.

The one from Boston.

1523
01:27:15,391 --> 01:27:16,463
Don't know.

1524
01:27:16,923 --> 01:27:18,225

1530
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:41,378

1532
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,389

1547
01:28:25,994 --> 01:28:27,502

1548

That is funny.

1549

1551
01:28:37,346 --> 01:28:40,395
Bengal... Lancer. Hmm?

1552
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:41,905
Oh, yeah.

1553
01:28:44,092 --> 01:28:46,179
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1554
01:28:47,246 --> 01:28:50,238
You do know kidnapping
is a hanging offense.

1555
01:28:50,637 --> 01:28:53,000
So is blowin' the
heads off little girls.

1556
01:28:55,118 --> 01:28:57,245

Right?

1558
01:28:58,978 --> 01:29:00,267
So...

1559
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:05,214
You come down here for a...
for a Boston social?

1560

1565
01:29:16,157 --> 01:29:17,181

1568
01:29:22,366 --> 01:29:23,612
I agree.

1569
01:29:25,179 --> 01:29:26,671

1570
01:29:27,143 --> 01:29:29,477

01:29:33,579 --> 01:29:37,769

01:29:41,838 --> 01:29:43,258
handin' me that $50,000,

1575
01:29:43,325 --> 01:29:46,682
I want the old man himself...

1576
01:29:46,837 --> 01:29:48,392
Murdoch Lancer

1577
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:51,704
puts $50,000 in my lap!

1578
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,361
Or I'll heave this little
pitcher down the well!

1579
01:29:55,864 --> 01:29:58,396
You got that, Boston?!

1580
01:29:58,761 --> 01:29:59,825
Ha?!

1581
01:30:00,356 --> 01:30:01,388
Yeah.

1582
01:30:02,464 --> 01:30:04,710
Alright, messenger boy...

1583
01:30:05,638 --> 01:30:07,106
deliver my message.

1584
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:17,216
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet...

1585
01:30:17,617 --> 01:30:19,196
Settle into it...

1586
01:30:19,537 --> 01:30:21,037
Enjoy it...

1587
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:23,029
And cut!

1588
01:30:25,389 --> 01:30:26,651
Oh, boy.

1589
01:30:26,845 --> 01:30:29,400
I didn't hurt you there,
Mirabella, with that throw, did I?

1590
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:32,323
No, no, no, I'm good.
I've got pads on.

1591
01:30:32,366 --> 01:30:35,342
I always throw myself on the
floor, just for fun,

1592
01:30:35,367 --> 01:30:36,938
even when I'm not getting paid.

1593
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:39,064
Next plate.

1594
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:42,945
Rick, Rick, Rick! Put her there!

1595
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,234
- Oh.
- That was it!

1596
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:46,936
That was absolutely fantastic.
I loved it!

1597
01:30:47,161 --> 01:30:48,598
Hey, and your idea about

1598
01:30:48,638 --> 01:30:50,160
throwing the little
girl on the ground,

1599
01:30:50,185 --> 01:30:51,566
that just worked like a charm.

1600
01:30:52,064 --> 01:30:54,295
- You said Shakespeare.
- Oh, that's right!

1601
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:57,070
And that's what I
mean by 'scare me'.

1602
01:30:57,095 --> 01:30:57,800
Yeah.

1603
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,553
Evil Hamlet scares people!

1604
01:30:59,578 --> 01:31:00,297
All right.

1605
01:31:00,322 --> 01:31:02,046
Oh, and by the way...

1606
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:04,264
"beaner bronco buster"?

1607
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:05,800
Where the hell did
that come from?

1608
01:31:05,825 --> 01:31:07,039
Improv.

1609
01:31:07,064 --> 01:31:08,271
It's wonderful.

1610
01:31:08,805 --> 01:31:11,289
It's a triple alliterative improv.

1611
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:13,374
Don't get those too often.

1612
01:31:13,437 --> 01:31:15,136
- Okay! We're all good!
- All right.

1613
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,667
- Don't need to go again?
- No, we're done.

1614
01:31:16,692 --> 01:31:17,929
That was fantastic!

1615
01:31:17,999 --> 01:31:20,531
Okay, we're moving on.
We're in the bordello.

1616
01:31:20,668 --> 01:31:21,644
Next set up.

1617
01:31:25,658 --> 01:31:29,436
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1618
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:32,178
Thank you.

1619
01:31:50,155 --> 01:31:52,124
Rick fucking Dalton.

1620
01:32:05,064 --> 01:32:06,135
That's a car.

1621
01:32:07,575 --> 01:32:09,107
That's a strange car.

1622
01:32:10,452 --> 01:32:12,285
Snake, go see who's outside.

1623
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,282
So, who is it?

1624
01:32:26,746 --> 01:32:28,015
I ain't sure yet.

1625
01:32:28,859 --> 01:32:30,557
Bitchin' yellow Coupe de Ville.

1626
01:32:31,566 --> 01:32:32,947
Keep an eye on it.

1627
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:23,121
Come on.

1628
01:33:40,036 --> 01:33:41,536
Where the hell is everybody?

1629
01:33:51,201 --> 01:33:52,534
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1630
01:33:52,971 --> 01:33:54,542
She's down by the chop shop.

1631
01:34:01,226 --> 01:34:03,179
- Hey!
- Hello!

1632
01:34:03,313 --> 01:34:06,250
Gypsy, I want you to
come meet my new friend.

1633
01:34:06,976 --> 01:34:08,673
Some old lookin' dude
on a Hawaiian shirt

1634
01:34:08,698 --> 01:34:10,849
who just gave
Pussycat a ride home.

1635
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:12,452
He just give her a lift?

1636
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:13,776
Nope.

1637
01:34:14,085 --> 01:34:16,331
She's bringing him down the
ranch to meet everybody.

1638
01:34:16,748 --> 01:34:18,042
Stay by the door,

1639
01:34:18,067 --> 01:34:19,605
tell me if he starts
comin' this way.

1640
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:23,768
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1641
01:34:23,907 --> 01:34:26,304
And thank you for giving our
precious Pussy a ride home.

1642
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:27,574
Think nothin' of it.

1643
01:34:27,867 --> 01:34:29,097
We love Pussy.

1644
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:30,888
Yes, we do.

1645
01:34:31,138 --> 01:34:33,082
Where is everybody?
Where's the children?

1646
01:34:33,162 --> 01:34:34,884
Everybody left for Santa Barbara.

1647
01:34:35,747 --> 01:34:36,755
Really?

1648
01:34:37,454 --> 01:34:39,057
Charlie's gone? Everybody left?

1649
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,503
Well, not everybody everybody
but mostly everybody.

1650
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:46,614
Dag.

1651
01:34:47,709 --> 01:34:49,645
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

1652
01:34:50,714 --> 01:34:52,825
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig ya.

1653
01:34:52,952 --> 01:34:54,619
- Hey, Delilah.
- Well, maybe next time.

1654
01:34:55,327 --> 01:34:56,525
Yeah, you gotta come back.

1655
01:34:58,172 --> 01:35:00,490
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure would.

1656
01:35:01,604 --> 01:35:04,263
How's it all comparing
to your glory days?

1657
01:35:04,712 --> 01:35:06,339
Well, things have changed.

1658
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:11,831
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1659
01:35:11,991 --> 01:35:14,237
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

1660
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,311
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1661
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:17,526
Well, every week.

1662
01:35:18,638 --> 01:35:19,551
All right.

1663
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:21,634
She's a darlin'.

1664
01:35:25,925 --> 01:35:28,639
So... my name is Lulu.

1665
01:35:28,877 --> 01:35:30,163
This is Tex.

1666
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:32,785
We're gonna be leading
you on a great trail ride

1667
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,834
to the beautiful
Santa Susana canyon.

1668
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:36,745
Now, uh...

1669
01:35:36,809 --> 01:35:38,966
Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

1670
01:35:38,991 --> 01:35:39,983
Yes.

1671
01:35:40,036 --> 01:35:42,241
- Yeah, and so are you, Connie?
- Yes, I am.

1672
01:35:42,266 --> 01:35:43,536
Tex, come here.

1673
01:35:43,651 --> 01:35:44,778
So, uh...

1674
01:35:44,849 --> 01:35:47,309
you're both experienced
riders, I guess, uh...

1675
01:35:47,334 --> 01:35:49,266
we'll just make this
ride about having fun!

1676
01:35:49,307 --> 01:35:50,718
Ready to have some fun?

1677
01:35:50,743 --> 01:35:53,418
So, uh, Pussycat brought
back some guy with her.

1678
01:35:53,558 --> 01:35:55,518
Gypsy wants you to go
give him a looksee.

1679
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:57,113
Yeah, sure thing.

1680
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:18,712
Oh, and here's someone
you actually have to meet.

1681
01:36:19,278 --> 01:36:21,810
One of our most favorite sons.

1682
01:36:21,874 --> 01:36:24,175
Tex, come over here
and say hi to Cliff.

1683
01:36:24,721 --> 01:36:26,625
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1684
01:36:26,984 --> 01:36:28,507
What part of Texas you from?

1685
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:30,230
Uh, place you never heard of.

1686
01:36:30,491 --> 01:36:31,689
Copeville.

1687
01:36:32,396 --> 01:36:33,682
Ever been to Houston?

1688
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:34,842
'Course I have.

1689
01:36:34,969 --> 01:36:37,842
Yeah, spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang

1690
01:36:37,919 --> 01:36:39,483
in August, no less.

1691
01:36:39,592 --> 01:36:41,873
That don't sound
like a whole lotta fun.

1692
01:36:42,538 --> 01:36:44,364
It's the last cop's
jaw I ever broke

1693
01:36:44,389 --> 01:36:45,658
I can tell ya that.

1694
01:36:49,537 --> 01:36:50,537
Man.

1695
01:36:51,923 --> 01:36:53,423
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1696
01:36:54,382 --> 01:36:56,414
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

1697
01:36:56,725 --> 01:36:58,598
Everybody's talkin' all friendly.

1698
01:37:02,595 --> 01:37:04,794
Tex checked him out
and now he's riding away.

1699
01:37:05,673 --> 01:37:07,744
He comes this way, let me know.

1700
01:37:10,233 --> 01:37:13,114
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

1701
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,193
Yeah, George still owns it.

1702
01:37:15,665 --> 01:37:17,062
Does he still live here?

1703
01:37:17,228 --> 01:37:18,284
Yeah.

1704
01:37:18,393 --> 01:37:21,075
Does he still live...
right there?

1705
01:37:21,226 --> 01:37:22,234
Yeah.

1706
01:37:22,385 --> 01:37:23,718
Is he here now?

1707
01:37:24,254 --> 01:37:25,706
I guess so.

1708
01:37:27,322 --> 01:37:30,099
So, George gave you all
permission to be here.

1709
01:37:31,238 --> 01:37:32,349
'Course he did.

1710
01:37:32,445 --> 01:37:34,246
And you all take care of him.

1711
01:37:35,108 --> 01:37:36,648
Oh, we take care of George.

1712
01:37:37,409 --> 01:37:38,679
We love George.

1713
01:37:40,789 --> 01:37:42,440
Well, is there anything wrong

1714
01:37:42,519 --> 01:37:44,932
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

1715
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:46,849
You can't see him right now.

1716
01:37:46,905 --> 01:37:48,913
Why can't I see him right now?

1717
01:37:50,544 --> 01:37:51,774
'Cause he's napping.

1718
01:37:53,997 --> 01:37:55,600
This is his naptime.

1719
01:38:05,496 --> 01:38:08,369
Well, I think I'll just go
see for myself.

1720
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,822
You never know.

1721
01:38:11,238 --> 01:38:13,309
He mighta just woke up.

1722
01:38:22,819 --> 01:38:24,938
The Hawaiian guy's
coming this way.

1723
01:38:25,819 --> 01:38:27,668
Okay, ya'll, beat it.

1724
01:38:27,879 --> 01:38:29,133
I'll handle this guy.

Can I help you?

1736
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:25,459
I hope so.

1737
01:39:25,499 --> 01:39:28,571
I'm an old friend of George's,
thought I'd stop and say hello.

1738
01:39:28,596 --> 01:39:29,692
Well, that's very nice of you,

1739
01:39:29,717 --> 01:39:31,895
but unfortunately,
you picked the wrong time.

1740
01:39:31,935 --> 01:39:33,651
George is taking a nap right now.

1741
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,670
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1742
01:39:36,039 --> 01:39:37,495
Yes, it is.

1743
01:39:38,507 --> 01:39:39,931
What's your name?

1744
01:39:39,956 --> 01:39:41,379
Cliff Booth.

1745
01:39:41,627 --> 01:39:42,726
How do you know George?

1746
01:39:42,751 --> 01:39:45,095
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

1747
01:39:45,261 --> 01:39:47,245
When was the last
time you saw George?

1748
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:50,876
Oh, I'd say about...

1749
01:39:51,471 --> 01:39:53,217
eight years ago.

1750
01:39:54,282 --> 01:39:55,264
Oh.

1751
01:39:55,839 --> 01:39:58,488
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
the two of you were so close.

1752
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:02,099
Well, when he wakes up,
I'll let him know you came by.

1753
01:40:02,617 --> 01:40:06,467
I'd really like to say a quick hello now,
while I'm here.

1754
01:40:06,519 --> 01:40:08,111
Came a long ways.

1755
01:40:08,136 --> 01:40:10,775
Don't know when I'll
get back this way again.

1756
01:40:11,328 --> 01:40:14,185
Oh, I understand but
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1757
01:40:14,688 --> 01:40:15,998
Impossible.

1758
01:40:16,335 --> 01:40:18,200
Why is that impossible?

1759
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:20,553
Because me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday nights.

1760
01:40:20,578 --> 01:40:21,804
FBI and Bonanza

1761
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:23,418
but George finds it hard
to keep awake that late

1762
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:24,623
so I make him take
a nap around now

1763
01:40:24,648 --> 01:40:26,672
so I don't get tripped out
of my George's TV time.

1764
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:31,287
Well, look, red,

1765
01:40:31,312 --> 01:40:33,053
I'm comin' in there.

1766
01:40:33,322 --> 01:40:34,745
With my own two eyes,

1767
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:37,054
I'm gonna get a
good look at George.

1768
01:40:38,274 --> 01:40:39,904
And this...

1769
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:42,929
ain't stoppin' me.

1770
01:40:46,372 --> 01:40:47,563
Okay.

1771
01:40:48,654 --> 01:40:49,944
Suit yourself.

1772
01:41:02,047 --> 01:41:03,483
<i>You never know.</i>

1773
01:41:05,324 --> 01:41:07,562
<i>The next boy you meet
may be the one.</i>

1774
01:41:40,621 --> 01:41:43,502
<i>So clean, it's actually
good for your skin.</i>

1775
01:41:43,794 --> 01:41:45,571
<i>So fresh and natural looking,</i>

1776
01:41:45,683 --> 01:41:47,467
<i>you're always ready for next time.</i>

1777
01:41:48,567 --> 01:41:50,123
<i>And you never know,</i>

1778
01:41:50,475 --> 01:41:52,856
<i>the next boy you meet
may be the one.</i>

1779
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:02,663
<i>Sparkling drop of Retsyn.</i>

1780
01:42:16,058 --> 01:42:17,546
He back there?

1781
01:42:19,105 --> 01:42:21,009
Door at the end of the hallway.

1782
01:42:22,177 --> 01:42:23,407
You might have to
shake him awake,

1783
01:42:23,455 --> 01:42:25,431
I fucked his brains
out this morning.

1784
01:42:30,975 --> 01:42:32,701
He may be tired.

1785
01:42:44,588 --> 01:42:46,715
Oh, Mister Eight-Years-Ago...

1786
01:42:48,045 --> 01:42:49,617
George is blind.

1787
01:42:49,642 --> 01:42:51,944
So you'll probably have to
tell him who you are.

1788
01:43:17,868 --> 01:43:19,505
George, you awake?

1789
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:38,780
George?

1790
01:43:40,807 --> 01:43:41,948
George?

1791
01:43:45,868 --> 01:43:46,999
George?

1792
01:43:49,664 --> 01:43:50,993
George!

1793
01:43:52,303 --> 01:43:53,413
Hi, George.

1794
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,920
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1795
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:58,751
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1796
01:43:59,479 --> 01:44:00,729
Who are you?

1797
01:44:00,798 --> 01:44:02,088
It's Cliff Booth.

1798
01:44:02,205 --> 01:44:05,369
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doin'.

1799
01:44:05,419 --> 01:44:07,086
John Wilkes Booth?

1800
01:44:07,165 --> 01:44:08,475
Cliff Booth.

1801
01:44:10,682 --> 01:44:11,952
Who's that?

1802
01:44:12,101 --> 01:44:14,690
I-I used to shoot
Bounty Law here, George.

1803
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,528
I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.

1804
01:44:16,955 --> 01:44:18,011
Who?

1805
01:44:18,036 --> 01:44:19,236
Rick Dalton.

1806
01:44:19,745 --> 01:44:21,461
The Dalton brothers...?

1807
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:22,830
Rick Dalton.

1808
01:44:24,628 --> 01:44:25,913
Who's that?

1809
01:44:25,938 --> 01:44:28,021
He was the star of Bounty Law.

1810
01:44:28,904 --> 01:44:30,253
Who are you?

1811
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:32,356
I was Rick's stunt double.

1812
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:35,206
Rick... who?

1813
01:44:35,385 --> 01:44:37,091
It don't matter, George.

1814
01:44:37,302 --> 01:44:40,382
We were colleagues from the past
and I just wanted to...

1815
01:44:40,407 --> 01:44:42,550
make sure you're doin' okay.

1816
01:44:42,575 --> 01:44:43,948
I'm not doin' okay.

1817
01:44:43,973 --> 01:44:45,010
What's the matter?

1818
01:44:45,035 --> 01:44:46,463
Can't see shit!

1819
01:44:46,808 --> 01:44:48,356
Would you call that "the matter"?

1820
01:44:48,428 --> 01:44:50,109
The man can't see shit, okay?

1821
01:44:50,134 --> 01:44:51,553
I'm sorry about that.

1822
01:44:51,578 --> 01:44:54,864
I was told...
Squeaky sent me to bed.

1823
01:44:55,558 --> 01:44:58,108
Would that be the little
redhead out front?

1824
01:45:00,714 --> 01:45:02,867
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

1825
01:45:03,403 --> 01:45:04,881
First, you wake me up,

1826
01:45:04,906 --> 01:45:07,326
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

1827
01:45:07,351 --> 01:45:09,445
I was fucking blind!

1828
01:45:09,524 --> 01:45:11,012
How am I gonna know

1829
01:45:11,046 --> 01:45:13,992
what the hell color
the head of the girl is

1830
01:45:14,017 --> 01:45:15,597
that's with me all the time?

1831
01:45:15,622 --> 01:45:17,398
Oh, fair enough, George.

1832
01:45:21,036 --> 01:45:23,060
No, it's all right.

1833
01:45:24,288 --> 01:45:27,115
Everyone don't need a stuntman.

1834
01:45:34,379 --> 01:45:36,393
I don't know who you are...

1835
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:40,669
but you touched me today.

1836
01:45:42,511 --> 01:45:44,738
You came to visit me.

1837
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:47,243
Now I gotta go back to sleep.

1838
01:45:49,777 --> 01:45:52,272
I gotta watch FBI tonight.

1839
01:45:52,297 --> 01:45:54,420
And I watch it with Squeaky.

1840
01:45:55,137 --> 01:45:58,113
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

1841
01:45:59,212 --> 01:46:02,148
What happens if
she gets pissed off, George?

1842
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,559
Nothin'.

1843
01:46:05,928 --> 01:46:08,368
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

1844
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:16,662
So, you gave all these
hippies permission to be here?

1845
01:46:22,329 --> 01:46:24,820
Just who the fuck are you?

1846
01:46:24,998 --> 01:46:26,655
I'm Cliff Booth.

1847
01:46:26,893 --> 01:46:28,197
I'm your stuntman.

1848
01:46:28,222 --> 01:46:30,266
We used to work
together, George.

1849
01:46:30,544 --> 01:46:32,984
I just wanna make
sure that you're okay.

1850
01:46:33,381 --> 01:46:36,424
That all these hippies aren't
taking advantage of ya.

1851
01:46:37,158 --> 01:46:39,281
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1852
01:46:40,052 --> 01:46:42,026
She loves me.

1853
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:46,398
So, suck on that.

1854
01:46:55,086 --> 01:46:56,693
Take care, George.

1855
01:47:03,623 --> 01:47:05,004
Goddammit.

1856
01:47:26,544 --> 01:47:28,320
You embarrassed me.

1857
01:47:29,124 --> 01:47:31,138
Yeah, sorry 'bout that.

1858
01:47:33,955 --> 01:47:35,641
How'd your little
talk with George go?

1859
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:36,936
Are we kidnapping him?

1860
01:47:36,961 --> 01:47:38,727
Not the word I'd use.

1861
01:47:38,793 --> 01:47:39,875
Well, now that
you've talked to him,

1862
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,095
do you believe
everything's all right?

1863
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,632
Not exactly.

1864
01:47:43,277 --> 01:47:44,984
This was a mistake,
you should leave!

1865
01:47:45,074 --> 01:47:46,562
Way aheada 'ya

1866
01:47:51,028 --> 01:47:52,992
George isn't blind!

1867
01:47:53,389 --> 01:47:55,254

Well, I just figured we would.

1934
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,771
I got a six-pack in the back,
thought we'd order a pizza.

1935
01:53:35,805 --> 01:53:36,798
All right.

1936
01:53:37,231 --> 01:53:38,250

Hey...

1941
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:15,648
bought me an acid-dipped
cigarette today.

1942
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:16,932
Oh, yeah?

1943
01:54:17,321 --> 01:54:19,190
You wanna buy a
cigarette dipped in acid?

1944
01:54:19,339 --> 01:54:20,434
Yeah.

1945
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,174
If I'm gonna trip,
I'm gonna trip here, man,

1946
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,655
walkin' the woods, not my home.

1947
01:54:27,268 --> 01:54:30,396
Just gonna stash it here,
don't smoke it by mistake.

1948
01:54:30,924 --> 01:54:33,813
You wanna smoke some, smoke
some, just save me some.

1949
01:54:34,241 --> 01:54:36,813
No, I don't need to
trip out on no acid.

1950

Uh-oh.

1963
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:20,918
Here comes trouble.

1964
01:55:23,623 --> 01:55:24,758
Boom!

1965
01:55:25,353 --> 01:55:27,107
Oh, man, right in the face.

1966
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:40,607
That was a smooth leap.

1967

01:55:56,668 --> 01:55:58,578
That guy's a fuckin' prick.

1971

That's Bobby Hogan, good guy.

Alright, get ready
for my big FBI moment.

After that Musso and
Frank's lunch meeting,

1995
01:57:39,329 --> 01:57:41,536
Marvin did provide Rick
job opportunities

1996
01:57:41,583 --> 01:57:43,139
in the Italian film industry.

1997
01:57:43,326 --> 01:57:46,135
Rick Dalton, Marvin Schwarz here.
Hold on.

Hennessy XO on the rocks.

1999
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:50,114
Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

2000
01:57:50,419 --> 01:57:54,284
Two words: Nebraska Jim,
Sergio Corbucci.

2001
01:57:54,376 --> 01:57:57,424
N-Nebraska what? Sergio who?

2002
01:57:57,514 --> 01:57:59,086
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

2003
01:57:59,165 --> 01:58:00,490
And who's that.

2004
01:58:00,747 --> 01:58:03,001
The second best director
of Spaghetti Westerns

2005
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:04,502
in the whole, wide world.

2006
01:58:04,615 --> 01:58:07,449
He's doing a new Western,
it's called Nebraska Jim.

2007
01:58:07,890 --> 01:58:10,009
And because of me,
he's considering you.

2008
01:58:11,490 --> 01:58:13,228
<i>Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim.</i>

2009
01:58:13,413 --> 01:58:15,659
<i>And Rick made a rather
compelling Nebraska Jim</i>

2010
01:58:15,699 --> 01:58:17,342
<i>existing quite nicely within</i>

2011
01:58:17,373 --> 01:58:20,683
<i>Sergio Corbucci's rogues' gallery
of antiheroes.</i>

2012
01:58:21,786 --> 01:58:23,992
<i>In Rome, Rick loved the paparazzi</i>

2013
01:58:24,072 --> 01:58:25,611
<i>and the fuss they made over him</i>

2014
01:58:25,636 --> 01:58:28,400
<i>and his Nebraska Jim co-star,
Daphna Ben-Cobo</i>

2015
01:58:29,189 --> 01:58:30,785
Right there, paparazzo.

2016
01:58:30,843 --> 01:58:32,415
<i>What about me-a Rick!</i>

2017
01:58:32,948 --> 01:58:34,336
<i>He loved the food so much</i>

2018
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:37,321
<i>that during his stay,
Rick gained almost 15 pounds.</i>

2019
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:40,779
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

2020
01:58:40,831 --> 01:58:42,108
<i>In fact, he thought
the post synched</i>

2021
01:58:42,164 --> 01:58:44,226
<i>every actor speaks
their own language</i>

2022

<i>Tower of Babel shooting

2023
01:58:46,593 --> 01:58:48,005

<i>While in Rome,</i>

2025
01:58:50,225 --> 01:58:53,106
<i>Marvin plugged Rick into three
other Italian productions.</i>

01:58:53,367 --> 01:58:54,724
<i>His second Western was</i>

2027
01:58:54,749 --> 01:58:56,971
<i>Kill Me Quick, Ringo,

2028
01:58:57,096 --> 01:58:58,658
<i>Also starring Joseph Cotten</i>

<i>and directed by

2030

<i>pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.</i>

2031
01:59:03,189 --> 01:59:05,721
<i>His third was an
Italian-Spanish co-production</i>

2032
01:59:05,789 --> 01:59:09,869
<i>that paired him with Telly Savalas
titled, Red Blood, Red Skin.</i>

<i>Ultimately making Rick's</i>

<i>six-month Italian sojourn
fairly profitable.</i>

2042
02:00:12,339 --> 02:00:14,339
<i>Although his swank
Roman apartment</i>

2043
02:00:14,427 --> 02:00:16,355
<i>ate up a big chunk
of his earnings.</i>

2044
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:20,927
<i>So, as Rick return to
Hollywood via Pan-Am...</i>

2045
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:23,317
<i>he has four new
movies under his belt,</i>

2046
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:24,834
<i>some money in his pocket,</i>

2047
02:00:24,886 --> 02:00:27,362
<i>and his brand spanking new
Italian wife</i>

2048
02:00:27,842 --> 02:00:29,858
<i>Scarlett Francesca Capucci.</i>

2049
02:00:32,705 --> 02:00:34,641
<i>Hurtling through the
air towards a new life</i>

2050
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:36,380
<i>and uncertain future,</i>

2051
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:39,661
<i>Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.</i>

2052
02:00:43,009 --> 02:00:44,413
<i>Way back in coach,</i>

2053
02:00:44,438 --> 02:00:46,826
<i>working on his
bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

2054
02:00:46,932 --> 02:00:50,154
<i>Cliff Booth returned
to Los Angeles as well.</i>

2055
02:00:50,771 --> 02:00:55,232
<i>He kept Rick company during his
entire six-month stay in Italy.</i>

2056
02:00:56,093 --> 02:00:58,585
However, as the two men
returned home,

2057
02:00:58,971 --> 02:01:00,423
they've come to
an understanding.

2058
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:02,019
Here it goes now.

2059
02:01:03,206 --> 02:01:04,595
With the, uh...

2060
02:01:05,888 --> 02:01:07,523
with the new wife, I, uh...

2061
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:11,582
I just, I-I can't afford
you anymore, Cliff.

2062
02:01:11,773 --> 02:01:12,708
You know.

2063
02:01:12,733 --> 02:01:15,452
I could barely afford
my own house anymore.

2064
02:01:15,501 --> 02:01:17,596
So, the plan is to...

2065
02:01:17,621 --> 02:01:19,163
sell the house and buy...

2066
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:21,347
buy a condo i-in Toluca Lake,

2067
02:01:21,418 --> 02:01:24,484
bank the money, you know,
live off it, that type of thing.

2068
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:27,376
Hopefully I'll score
come next pilot season.

2069
02:01:27,982 --> 02:01:29,219
It's a good plan.

2070
02:01:29,244 --> 02:01:30,340
Yeah.

2071
02:01:31,413 --> 02:01:34,583
But I don't know if I
have a career or not, if...

2072
02:01:34,709 --> 02:01:37,668
I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says

2073
02:01:37,702 --> 02:01:40,490
or if I'm
one step closer to

2074
02:01:40,551 --> 02:01:42,066
going back to Missouri.

2075
02:01:42,991 --> 02:01:45,539
When this whole European
journey's over,

2076
02:01:45,594 --> 02:01:47,372
I think we've, uh...

2077
02:01:48,502 --> 02:01:50,572
we've reached the
end of the trail, Cliff.

2078
02:02:02,145 --> 02:02:04,057
<i>So, these last four
Italian flicks,</i>

2079
02:02:04,121 --> 02:02:05,661
<i>after nine years together,</i>

2080
02:02:05,886 --> 02:02:08,172
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's
final rodeo.</i>

2081
02:02:09,117 --> 02:02:11,443
<i>Cliff doesn't have a
clue what he's gonna do.</i>

2082
02:02:11,698 --> 02:02:14,016
<i>The only thing the two
men know of for sure,</i>

2083
02:02:14,088 --> 02:02:17,470
<i>tonight, Rick and Cliff will have
a good, old-fashioned drunk.</i>

2084
02:02:17,701 --> 02:02:21,017
<i>Both men know once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,</i>

2085
02:02:21,042 --> 02:02:23,344
<i>it'll be an end of an era
for both of them.</i>

2086
02:02:23,509 --> 02:02:26,128
<i>When you come to the end of
the line with a buddy who is</i>

2087
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:28,572
<i>more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,</i>

2088
02:02:28,602 --> 02:02:29,864
<i>getting blind drunk together</i>

2089
02:02:29,889 --> 02:02:32,713

02:13:36,435 --> 02:13:37,547
Who are you?

2264
02:13:37,705 --> 02:13:38,959
And who are you here to see, huh?

2265
02:13:39,049 --> 02:13:41,636
Nobody, sir. We just got lost.
I'm a little turned around.

2266
02:13:41,701 --> 02:13:43,002
Ah, horseshit.

2267
02:13:46,039 --> 02:13:49,484
Fuckin' hippies came up here to
smoke dope on a dark road, huh?

2268
02:13:49,792 --> 02:13:52,204
Next time you wanna try that,
fix your fuckin' muffler.

2269
02:13:52,365 --> 02:13:54,261
Look, we're really
sorry we disturbed you.

2270
02:13:54,335 --> 02:13:56,319
Look, chief,
you don't belong here.

2271
02:13:56,499 --> 02:13:58,463
Now take this mechanical asshole

2272
02:13:58,597 --> 02:14:01,305
and get it off my fuckin' street!

2273
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:14,959
Hey!

2274
02:14:15,373 --> 02:14:16,556
Dennis Hopper!

2275
02:14:16,595 --> 02:14:18,178
Move this fuckin' piece of shit.

2276
02:14:18,266 --> 02:14:20,544
All right, well, just give me
a moment to turn it around.

2277
02:14:20,624 --> 02:14:22,449
Well, drive it backwards, numbnuts.

2278
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:24,428
Fuckin' drive it and drive it now!

2279
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:26,170
Okay, okay, stop yellin'.

2280
02:14:26,210 --> 02:14:27,622
Hold your horses. We're leavin'.

2281
02:14:27,995 --> 02:14:31,527

2282
02:14:31,648 --> 02:14:34,656
The hell you lookin' at,
you little ginger hair fucker?

2283
02:14:35,542 --> 02:14:38,367
Hey, come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fuckin' cops.

2284
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:47,078
Dirty fuckin' hippies.

2285
02:15:00,112 --> 02:15:02,891
Very fancy fucking house,
thinks we're animals.

2286
02:15:02,916 --> 02:15:04,099
But he's seen us.

2287
02:15:04,274 --> 02:15:06,123
He's awake. He's awake.

2288
02:15:06,456 --> 02:15:07,560
They're all awake.

2289
02:15:07,641 --> 02:15:09,086
They're listening to fucking records.

2290
02:15:09,141 --> 02:15:10,880
Everybody's fucking awake!

2291
02:15:10,962 --> 02:15:12,058
Look!

2292
02:15:12,145 --> 02:15:13,423
What did Charlie say?

2293
02:15:13,497 --> 02:15:14,677
He said...

2294
02:15:14,751 --> 02:15:16,521
"Go to Terry's old house

2295
02:15:16,592 --> 02:15:18,537
"and kill everybody in there."

2296
02:15:18,986 --> 02:15:20,525
And you heard him yourself.

2297
02:15:20,916 --> 02:15:22,726
He said make it witchy.

2298
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:25,387
Now, he either said that...

2299
02:15:25,799 --> 02:15:27,545
or I'm a liar.

2300
02:15:28,981 --> 02:15:30,767
Now, are anyone o' you...

2301
02:15:30,823 --> 02:15:32,108
calling me a liar?

2302
02:15:33,158 --> 02:15:34,126
Hmm?

2303
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:36,398
How about you?

2304
02:15:36,898 --> 02:15:38,557
Are you calling me a liar?

2305
02:15:39,847 --> 02:15:41,419
No, of course not.

2306
02:15:41,986 --> 02:15:42,954
Good.

2307
02:15:43,025 --> 02:15:44,184
Hold it.

2308
02:15:44,494 --> 02:15:46,097
Was that Rick Dalton?

2309
02:15:46,189 --> 02:15:47,173
Who?

2310
02:15:47,237 --> 02:15:48,355
The guy from Bounty Law.

2311
02:15:48,387 --> 02:15:49,554
Who, Jake Cahill?

2312
02:15:49,596 --> 02:15:52,819
Yeah! That guy in the road
was Jake Cahill.

2313
02:15:52,847 --> 02:15:54,141
Ho... wait a minute.

2314
02:15:54,189 --> 02:15:56,816
That was fucking Jake Cahill
that just yelled at us?

2315
02:15:57,214 --> 02:15:59,056
He was older,
but yeah, I think so.

2316
02:15:59,098 --> 02:16:00,336
Who's this Rick guy?

2317
02:16:00,371 --> 02:16:02,283
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together!

2318
02:16:02,326 --> 02:16:03,627
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill

2319
02:16:03,652 --> 02:16:05,881
on a cowboy show in the
50s called Bounty Law.

2320
02:16:05,963 --> 02:16:07,661
Fuck you, Katie.

2321
02:16:07,694 --> 02:16:10,845
Sorry I don't know the name of
every fascist dog TV in the 50s.

2322
02:16:10,968 --> 02:16:13,706
I can't believe that
asshole in the road

2323
02:16:13,746 --> 02:16:15,409
was Jake Cahill!

2324
02:16:15,490 --> 02:16:18,411
When I was a kid,
I had a Bounty Law lunch box.

2325
02:16:18,437 --> 02:16:21,381
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

2326
02:16:22,099 --> 02:16:24,060
Dig this...

2327
02:16:24,889 --> 02:16:26,603
You've been having
our trip session,

2328
02:16:26,628 --> 02:16:29,115
I've been expanding on
this one idea in my head.

2329
02:16:29,615 --> 02:16:30,901
Alright, dig it.

2330
02:16:31,163 --> 02:16:33,441
We all grew up watchin' TV,
you know what I mean?

2331
02:16:34,566 --> 02:16:36,510
And if you grew up watchin' TV,

2332
02:16:36,574 --> 02:16:38,431
that means you grew up
watchin' murder.

2333
02:16:39,321 --> 02:16:42,639
Every show on TV
that wasn't I-I Love Lucy

2334
02:16:42,710 --> 02:16:43,909
was about murder.

2335
02:16:44,262 --> 02:16:46,572
So, my idea is...

2336
02:16:47,123 --> 02:16:49,615
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

2337
02:16:51,588 --> 02:16:53,120
I mean, where the
fuck are we, man?

2338
02:16:53,168 --> 02:16:55,533
We are in fucking Hollywood, man!

2339
02:16:55,585 --> 02:16:57,109
The people an entire generation

2340
02:16:57,134 --> 02:16:59,427
grew up watching kill
people live here.

2341
02:16:59,562 --> 02:17:01,839
And they live in
pigshit fucking luxury.

2342
02:17:01,931 --> 02:17:03,106
I say, fuck 'em.

2343
02:17:03,164 --> 02:17:05,507
I say we cut their cocks up
and make 'em eat it.

2344
02:17:06,213 --> 02:17:07,951
That's a great idea, Sadie.

2345
02:17:10,481 --> 02:17:12,338
You two ready to kill some pigs?

2346
02:17:21,644 --> 02:17:22,739
Wait a minute.

2347
02:17:22,905 --> 02:17:23,993
Uh, shit.

2348
02:17:24,199 --> 02:17:26,382
Sor... I forgot my knife
in the car.

2349
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,425
Can I go-
Can I go back and get it?

2350
02:17:29,566 --> 02:17:31,041
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

2351
02:17:31,558 --> 02:17:32,820
- Wait a minute.
- What?

2352
02:17:32,891 --> 02:17:35,050
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

2353
02:17:38,231 --> 02:17:39,128
Oh.

2354
02:17:39,390 --> 02:17:40,326
Right.

2355
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:41,636
Thank you.

2356
02:17:41,771 --> 02:17:43,305
Okay. I'll be right back.

2357
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:45,140
Hurry up.

2358
02:17:45,165 --> 02:17:46,926
Yes, uh, just-just a little minute.

2359
02:17:57,312 --> 02:17:58,899
Ooh, that fucking bitch!

2360
02:17:58,962 --> 02:18:00,129
Shhh, calm down.

2361
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:01,728
There's a fuckin'
house right there.

2362
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:04,438
What do we do now?

2363
02:18:04,517 --> 02:18:05,994
Well, we do
what we came to do.

2364
02:18:06,067 --> 02:18:08,307
And when we're done, we just
split up and hitch home.

2365
02:18:08,911 --> 02:18:11,093
Any more questions, hmm?

2366
02:18:13,464 --> 02:18:14,781
Okay, pig killers.

2367
02:18:14,861 --> 02:18:16,289
Let's kill some piggies.

2368
02:18:30,327 --> 02:18:31,931
Oh, somebody's hungry.

2369
02:18:40,917 --> 02:18:41,941
All right.

2370
02:18:44,044 --> 02:18:45,378
It's feedin' time.

2371
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:50,036
Brandy, couch.

2372
02:18:56,583 --> 02:18:58,194
And don't you move.

2373
02:19:06,495 --> 02:19:07,487
Oh, man...

2374
02:19:11,143 --> 02:19:12,016
Aaah...

2375
02:19:17,603 --> 02:19:19,333
The train has left the station.

2376
02:19:21,098 --> 02:19:22,043

2377
02:19:22,957 --> 02:19:23,814

2378
02:19:26,409 --> 02:19:27,544

2397
02:22:46,905 --> 02:22:49,032
Well, get him, bring him
into the living room.

2398
02:22:50,266 --> 02:22:51,472
What if he says no?

2399
02:22:51,497 --> 02:22:53,450
Don't take no for an answer.
You're the one with the knife.

2400

02:23:27,725 --> 02:23:28,835

02:23:35,549 --> 02:23:36,486

Who the fuck's that?

2409
02:23:41,049 --> 02:23:42,049

your white, little face.

2421
02:24:14,829 --> 02:24:17,059

02:28:27,792 --> 02:28:28,951
Francesca!

2441
02:28:29,229 --> 02:28:30,483
Francesca, honey!

2442
02:28:51,845 --> 02:28:54,384
<i>Sir, around what time was it that
you confronted the intruders?</i>

2443
02:28:55,005 --> 02:28:56,950
<i>About, uh, about midnight.</i>

2444
02:28:56,975 --> 02:28:58,388
<i>- Around midnight?
- Yeah.</i>

2445
02:28:58,437 --> 02:28:59,762
<i>How do you know
it was midnight?</i>

2446
02:28:59,923 --> 02:29:03,407
<i>Well... I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen, uh...</i>

2447
02:29:03,902 --> 02:29:05,736
<i>makin' margaritas and, uh...</i>

2448
02:29:06,456 --> 02:29:09,004
<i>I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler,</i>

2449
02:29:09,091 --> 02:29:11,141
<i>I looked up at the
clock, it said, uh...</i>

2450
02:29:11,166 --> 02:29:12,665
<i>the kitchen clock said midnight.</i>

2451
02:29:12,819 --> 02:29:14,604
<i>12:00 exactly?</i>

2452
02:29:14,761 --> 02:29:17,629
It could've been 12:05,
somethin' like that.

2453
02:29:17,654 --> 02:29:18,701
And you didn't see 'em again

2454
02:29:18,726 --> 02:29:20,479
until the woman attacked
you in the pool?

2455
02:29:21,398 --> 02:29:22,533
No. No.

2456
02:29:23,462 --> 02:29:25,454
What did these perpetrators do?

2457
02:29:25,589 --> 02:29:27,811
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

2458
02:29:28,403 --> 02:29:31,180
Two of 'em burst through
the front door there...

2459
02:29:31,922 --> 02:29:35,438
And the guy hippie said
he was the devil.

2460
02:29:36,348 --> 02:29:38,308
And he said, "I'm here to...

2461
02:29:39,165 --> 02:29:41,380
do some... devil shit."

2462
02:29:41,446 --> 02:29:43,517
It's not verbatim, but...

2463
02:29:44,099 --> 02:29:45,195
Some devil shit?

2464
02:29:45,282 --> 02:29:46,806
Yeah, devil shit.

2465
02:30:00,693 --> 02:30:02,900
And away we go!

2466
02:30:06,794 --> 02:30:08,817
W-W-Wait a minute.

2467
02:30:08,905 --> 02:30:11,238
What hospital you goin' to, Cliff?
I'll meet you there, huh?

2468
02:30:11,385 --> 02:30:13,727
Ah, you don't wanna
meet me in no hospital.

2469
02:30:14,004 --> 02:30:15,782
Why don't you take
care of your lady?

2470
02:30:15,834 --> 02:30:18,930
Hey, she just took five
fuckin' sleeping pills.

2471
02:30:19,044 --> 02:30:20,980
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

2472
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,046
You guys'll probably have to

2473
02:30:22,071 --> 02:30:24,269
come out here again
just to wake her ass up.

2474
02:30:24,502 --> 02:30:26,795
Hey, I'm not gonna die,
I may get a limp

2475
02:30:26,820 --> 02:30:29,502
but I ain't gonna die,
it's not my time yet, man.

2476
02:30:29,604 --> 02:30:32,199
All right? No use waitin'
in some waitin' room.

2477
02:30:32,224 --> 02:30:34,987
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature?

2478
02:30:35,465 --> 02:30:38,060
Come visit me tomorrow.
Bring bagels.

2479
02:30:39,874 --> 02:30:42,080
You wanna do somethin' for me,
check on Brandy.

2480
02:30:42,105 --> 02:30:44,178
She may be a little
shook up after that.

2481
02:30:44,203 --> 02:30:45,254
She may wanna sleep with ya.

2482
02:30:45,279 --> 02:30:46,516
Are you kiddin' me?

2483
02:30:46,564 --> 02:30:48,135
She's sleeping with
Francesca right now.

2484
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,764
You might never get her back.

2485
02:30:50,695 --> 02:30:51,606
We gotta go.

2486
02:30:51,631 --> 02:30:53,154
All right then, Cliff.

2487
02:30:53,789 --> 02:30:54,868
See you tomorrow, then.

2488
02:30:58,327 --> 02:30:59,890
Hey! Hey...

2489
02:31:03,626 --> 02:31:05,284
You're a good friend, Cliff.

2490
02:31:06,912 --> 02:31:08,198
I try.

2491
02:31:40,419 --> 02:31:41,491
Hello?

2492
02:31:43,415 --> 02:31:44,439
Hey.

2493
02:31:44,558 --> 02:31:46,836
I'm Jay Sebring, I'm a
friend of the Polanskis.

2494
02:31:47,555 --> 02:31:49,721
You're Rick Dalton, right?

2495
02:31:50,359 --> 02:31:53,463
Yeah, yeah... I'm Rick Dalton.

2496
02:31:53,972 --> 02:31:55,877
- I live next door.
- Oh, I know.

2497
02:31:55,902 --> 02:31:58,624
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

2498
02:31:58,803 --> 02:32:00,731
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman's head,

2499
02:32:00,771 --> 02:32:02,358
she just has to go
next door, right?

2500
02:32:04,161 --> 02:32:05,320
No shit?

2501
02:32:06,026 --> 02:32:08,376
What the fuck happened?

2502
02:32:08,577 --> 02:32:12,252
Oh, these... these fucking
hippie weirdos, th-they...

2503
02:32:12,324 --> 02:32:13,847
they broke into my house.

2504
02:32:14,439 --> 02:32:15,971
What do you mean,
like, trying to rob you?

2505
02:32:16,111 --> 02:32:17,960
I don't know what
the fuck they wanted...

2506
02:32:18,206 --> 02:32:20,269
Were they robbin' me?
I don't know, were they...

2507
02:32:20,343 --> 02:32:22,184
freakin' out on
some bummer trip?

2508
02:32:22,209 --> 02:32:23,554
Who knows, but...

2509
02:32:23,579 --> 02:32:25,642
they tried to kill
my wife and my buddy.

2510
02:32:25,745 --> 02:32:27,191
Jesus Christ, are you serious?

2511
02:32:27,232 --> 02:32:29,066
Yeah, I'm fuckin' serious.

2512
02:32:29,203 --> 02:32:32,378
My buddy and his dog
killed two of 'em, and, uh...

2513
02:32:33,044 --> 02:32:35,846
shit, I... torched the last one.

2514
02:32:36,065 --> 02:32:37,938
- Torched?
- Yeah.

2515
02:32:38,295 --> 02:32:39,962
I burned her ass to a crisp.

2516
02:32:40,604 --> 02:32:41,707
How'd you do that?

2517
02:32:41,938 --> 02:32:43,422
Believe it or not, I...

2518
02:32:43,787 --> 02:32:45,889
I got a flamethrower
in my tool shed.

2519
02:32:45,914 --> 02:32:48,157
From The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey?

2520
02:32:48,547 --> 02:32:49,658
Yeah!

2521
02:32:50,648 --> 02:32:51,632
Yeah.

2522
02:32:51,657 --> 02:32:53,521
Th-That's the one.

2523
02:32:53,596 --> 02:32:55,167
It still works, too.

2524
02:32:55,294 --> 02:32:56,493
Thank God.

2525
02:32:56,784 --> 02:32:58,395
Hey, is everybody okay?

2526
02:32:58,459 --> 02:32:59,657
Well...

2527
02:32:59,819 --> 02:33:01,152
the fuckin' hippies aren't.

2528
02:33:01,306 --> 02:33:02,493
That's for goddamn sure.

2529
02:33:02,548 --> 02:33:03,628
Yeah.

2530
02:33:03,653 --> 02:33:05,486
But I'm fine, you know, uh...

2531
02:33:05,595 --> 02:33:07,595
my wife's fine, we're just, uh...

2532
02:33:07,709 --> 02:33:09,368
a little shook up, is all.

2533
02:33:09,466 --> 02:33:11,011
Oh, my God, that's terrifying.

2534
02:33:11,469 --> 02:33:12,532
Yeah.

2535
02:33:12,850 --> 02:33:15,477
<i>Jay, honey,
is everything all right?</i>

2536
02:33:15,635 --> 02:33:17,310
Everything's okay now, honey.

2537
02:33:17,455 --> 02:33:20,368
Uh, but hippies broke
into the house next door.

2538
02:33:20,650 --> 02:33:22,095
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2539
02:33:22,456 --> 02:33:23,974
<i>Well, that's terrifying.</i>

2540
02:33:24,543 --> 02:33:26,138
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2541
02:33:26,338 --> 02:33:29,926
I'm talking to your next door
neighbor about it right now.

2542
02:33:30,330 --> 02:33:31,727
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

2543
02:33:33,369 --> 02:33:35,227
Yeah! That's me.

2544
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:38,519
<i>Oh! Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

2545
02:33:39,218 --> 02:33:40,655
<i>Everybody okay?</i>

2546
02:33:41,209 --> 02:33:44,248
Yes, yes, Sharon,
e-everybody's fine.

2547
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:45,661
<i>Are you okay?</i>

2548
02:33:47,955 --> 02:33:49,697
Yes, I am, thank you
for asking that.

2549
02:33:51,181 --> 02:33:53,688
<i>Rick, would you like to come
up to the house for a drink</i>

2550
02:33:53,721 --> 02:33:55,189
<i>meet my other friends?</i>

2551
02:34:01,559 --> 02:34:04,543
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

2552
02:34:04,717 --> 02:34:07,558
<i>Oh, hooray!
Great, I'll buzz you up.</i>

2553
02:34:23,430 --> 02:34:25,628
Hey, man, nice to meet you.

2554
02:34:25,832 --> 02:34:27,030
I'm Jay Sebring.

2555
02:34:55,608 --> 02:34:56,886
Hi, Rick.

2556
02:34:57,004 --> 02:34:58,498
Sharon, hi.

2557
02:34:58,559 --> 02:35:01,019
Oh, it's so nice to
finally meet you.

2558
02:35:01,373 --> 02:35:02,667
Nice to meet you.

2559
02:37:50,631 --> 02:37:52,583
Hi, this is Rick Dalton

2560
02:37:52,608 --> 02:37:55,092
better known as bounty
hunter Jake Cahill.

2561
02:37:55,303 --> 02:37:58,647
Speaking on behalf of
Red Apple Cigarettes.

2562
02:37:58,850 --> 02:38:01,904
Now, I smoke Red Apples,
been smokin' 'em for years.

2563
02:38:01,929 --> 02:38:06,881
But since the Red Apple Tobacco
Comany's been around since 1862,

2564
02:38:07,053 --> 02:38:10,170
you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple, too.

2565
02:38:10,412 --> 02:38:12,106
Now, back in Jake's day,

2566
02:38:12,139 --> 02:38:15,272
Red Apple came in a pouch
and he had to roll his own.

2567
02:38:15,646 --> 02:38:18,646
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

2568
02:38:18,702 --> 02:38:22,209
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor

2569
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:24,153
with less burn on your throat

2570
02:38:24,178 --> 02:38:26,982
than any other
non-filter cigarette.

2571
02:38:33,264 --> 02:38:34,327
Mm.

2572
02:38:36,280 --> 02:38:38,678
Now, that's the way a
cigarette should taste.

2573
02:38:38,741 --> 02:38:39,903
Hm.

2574
02:38:39,928 --> 02:38:42,506
Better drag, more flavor,

2575
02:38:42,889 --> 02:38:44,491
less throat burn.

2576
02:38:46,873 --> 02:38:48,483
That's the Red Apple way.

2577
02:38:49,506 --> 02:38:52,241
So look for this
lifesize standee of me,

2578
02:38:52,294 --> 02:38:53,935
Jake Cahill wherever fine

2579
02:38:53,960 --> 02:38:56,358
Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

2580
02:38:56,889 --> 02:38:59,397
Take a bite and feel all right.

2581
02:39:00,342 --> 02:39:02,678
Take a bite of a Red Apple.

2582
02:39:03,662 --> 02:39:05,045
Tell 'em Jake sent ya.

2583
02:39:08,647 --> 02:39:09,764
And cut.

2584
02:39:09,789 --> 02:39:11,514
Alright, this cigarette
is fucking shit.

2585
02:39:11,539 --> 02:39:13,083
By the way, who
chose this photo, all right?

2586
02:39:13,108 --> 02:39:14,653
I have a double chin, all right?

2587
02:39:14,678 --> 02:39:16,585
Nobody noticed that crap?!
